What Is MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment
MAXTERRA® MgO  Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Panels are engineered to deliver superior fire resistance, acoustic performance, and dimensional stability for today’s demanding job sites. Manufactured from magnesium oxide (MgO) with reinforcing glass fiber mesh, MAXTERRA® panels provide a high-density, fire-resistant solution. They are designed for use as flooring underlayment over wood structural panels, serving as a durable replacement for other underlayment products such as wet-laid gypsum in both sound- and fire-rated assemblies.
Applications
MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Panels are engineered and tested for use across a wide range of flooring underlayment applications, delivering proven performance in sound control, fire resistance, and structural durability. MAXTERRA® provides a more durable and dimensionally stable solution and is ideally suited for multifamily, hospitality, modular, and other high-performance construction projects. 
MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Panels are recognized by the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) under Evaluation Report ESR-5192 and Listing Report ESL-1645.
Skip-the-Gyp™ Advantage
MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Panels are engineered to achieve code-required STC/IIC sound ratings without the need for gypsum cement underlayment or sound mats, when installed as part of tested floor/ceiling assemblies. Unlike gypsum cement, MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Panels eliminate the need for a separate gypsum underlayment trade, additional sill plates, modifications to door headers, and additional project oversight – all while avoiding long cure times, cleanup, and callbacks that can delay or halt construction schedules. The result is a faster, cleaner, and more efficient installation process with reliable performance.

Floor Covering
Many types of finished floor coverings can be installed over MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Panels. Before applying any floor covering, always check the flooring manufacturer’s installation requirements and confirm compatibility with the substrate. Follow all requirements for primers, adhesives, mortars, feathering compounds, and related materials.

Floor coverings commonly installed over MAXTERRA® panels include (but are not limited to): Carpet, Engineered wood flooring, Vinyl, LVP, LVT, & Tile (tile requires an additional tile backer underlayment).

Refer to the MAXTERRA® Underlayment Installation Manual for complete information regarding finished flooring installation.
Fasteners
Fasteners used with MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Panels must be code-recognized and inherently resistant to corrosion, or factory-coated for corrosion resistance (electro-galvanized or better). Use only approved fasteners suitable for the specific assembly and substrate to ensure long-term performance.  Refer to the MAXTERRA® MgO Fire- And Water-Resistant Underlayment Installation Manual for complete information regarding fastener schedules.
