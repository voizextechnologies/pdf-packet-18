What Are MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels
MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels are high-performance subfloor panels with tongue and groove edges engineered to deliver fire resistance, acoustical performance, structural performance, and long-term durability in a single product. 
Applications
MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels are engineered and tested for use on wood and cold-formed steel framing across a wide range of structural subfloor applications, delivering superior structural performance, fire resistance, acoustic control, and long-term durability. Designed to replace traditional plywood, OSB, wet-laid gypsum underlayment, or concrete deck systems, MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels provide a stronger, more dimensionally stable platform that meets the demands of multifamily, hospitality, modular, and other high-performance construction projects. MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels are recognized by the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) under Evaluation Report ESR-5194, Listing Report ESL-1645, and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) under Report R41539 confirming compliance for use in fire-rated and sound-rated floor assemblies across Types I–V construction. 
Skip-the-Gyp™ & Ditch-the-Deck™ Advantage
MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels are engineered as a single-layer system that delivers a faster, cleaner, and more efficient installation process while achieving code-required STC/IIC sound when installed as part of tested floor/ceiling assemblies. Unlike gypsum cement underlayment or costly and complex pan-and-pour systems, MAXTERRA® panels eliminate the need for a separate wet-floor trades, door header or base plate modifications, added project oversight, and lengthy cure times that can delay or halt construction schedules. The result is a streamlined, single-trade solution that ensures reliable fire, sound, and structural performance across all types of high-demand projects.

Floor Covering
Many types of finished floor coverings can be installed over MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels. Before applying any floor covering, always check the flooring manufacturer’s installation requirements and confirm compatibility with the substrate. Follow all requirements for primers, adhesives, mortars, self-levelers, underlayment, and related materials. Floor coverings commonly installed over MAXTERRA® panels include (but are not limited to): Engineered wood flooring, Vinyl, LVP, LVT, Carpet, & Tile (tile requires an additional tile backer underlayment). Refer to the MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Installation Guide for complete information regarding finished flooring installation: www.nexgenbp.com/resources
Fasteners
Fasteners used with MAXTERRA® MgO Non-Combustible Structural Floor Panels must be code-recognized and inherently resistant to corrosion, or factory-coated for corrosion resistance (electro-galvanized or better). Use only approved fasteners suitable for the specific assembly and substrate to ensure long-term performance.
